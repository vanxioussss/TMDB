```

🔧 Prerequisites
--------------

- 🧑‍💻 **Android Studio**: [Meerkat](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- 🛠️ **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.10.1
- ⚙️ **Gradle**: 8.11.1
- 🔑 **MovieDB API key**: You will have to create a MovieDB account to get an API key.

✨ Key Features
--------------

- 🔎 Search Movies — Explore movies with real-time search using TMDB API.

- 🎬 Trending Movies — See what's trending today.

- 💾 Offline-First Architecture — Local caching with Room to allow browsing without immediate network access.

- ⚡ Pagination Support — Infinite scrolling for large movie search results.

- 📱 Modern Android UI — Built with Jetpack Compose.

- 📦 Multiplatform Ready — Business logic shared between Android and future iOS.

- 🔑 Secrets Handling — API keys securely handled with local properties.

🏗️ How to Build
--------------

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ptv1811/pexels.git
   ```

2. Create a `secrets.properties` file at root directory and fill in these options:
    ```
    MOVIE_DB_API_TOKEN=<API key>
    ```

3. Sync the build project as usual.

🧠 Decision Making
-------------
This section outlines the rationale behind key architectural and UX decisions made during the
development of this application.

- 🏗️ **Architecture**:

  **Clean Architecture + MVVM** \
  Ensures clear separation of concerns across layers: UI, Domain, and Data. Each layer has a
  well-defined responsibility, improving testability and maintainability.

  **Modularization** \
  Even though the app requirements are simple, the project is modularized to support scalability.
  This allows different features to be developed in isolation without conflicts, making the codebase
  future-proof and team-friendly.

  **Single Activity with Navigation Compose** \
  The app uses a single-activity architecture, with each feature represented by a Fragment. This
  centralizes navigation and simplifies lifecycle handling across screens.

- 🗄️**Cache Validation Strategy**:

    **Why Cache?** \
    Reduces redundant network calls, improves loading speed, enhances offline support, and minimizes TMDB API quota usage.

    **Cache Expiry (Validation Time)** \
    Cached data is considered valid for 24 hours by default. After that, a fresh fetch from the API is triggered when the user accesses that content again.

    **Why 24 Hours?** \

    Trending and popular movies don’t change frequently on TMDB’s end.

    Balances performance (reduces unnecessary network usage) with data freshness.

    Customizable in the future — individual features (e.g., trending, search) can have different expiry strategies.

- 🎨 **UI/UX Decision**:

  **Real-Time Image Search** \
  As the user types, search results update in real time, creating an engaging and dynamic
  experience. Input is debounced to prevent excessive network requests.

🚀 Future Improvements
---------------
Some planned or possible enhancements:

**Improve image loading performance** \
Currently the time to load each image is still high. Also when we scroll far away, when coming back to start of the image list, some images is already been cleared due to memory issue.

**Improve reusability** \
Some components can be implemented in a generic way to reuse between different modules.

**Support Build variants** \
Due to time constraint, I don't have enough time to support build variance but it will be a good
improvements in the future.

**Support for Light/Dark Theme**  
Provide full support for dark mode following Material guidelines.
